# ubuntu_common_issues

I have two computers, a desktop (Dell XPS w/ RTX 2070) and a laptop (MSI-G75 w/ RTX 2070) that I mainly use for Deep Learning and programming.
I am running Dual Boot on both. Since ubuntu is great for coding but has issues often, here I am listing the most useful scripts to sorting the most common issues. 

Hope this helps and happy coding, 
Jan
